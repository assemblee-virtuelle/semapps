title: Migration Service
---

Service to migrate keys from the deprecated `KeypairService` to the new `KeysService`. The old one uses a file system key store, the new one stores keys in the db.
Note, you can only use the new keys service if you have migrated your keys.

# Migration to the new keys service store
