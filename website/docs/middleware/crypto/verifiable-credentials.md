[Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-overview/) Services.

## Features

- Issue and verify Verifiable Credentials (VCs).
- Create and verify Verifiable Presentations (VPs).
- Support for [capability-based authorization](#issuing-and-verifying-capabilities) using VCs.
- Data integrity proofs for signing and verifying objects.
- Challenge service for creating and validating challenges.
- An [API](#vc-api) to issue and verify VCs and VPs.

All signatures use the EdDSA RDFC 2022 Data Integrity Cryptosuite.

Note that the [ActivityPub Fediverse Enhancement Proposal (FEP) 8b32](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/8b32/fep-8b32.md) uses the VC data integrity specification as well. However they use a different crypto suite. See the open issue for SemApps https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/semapps/issues/1364.

For SemApps, the WebId document serves as the Controlled Identifier Document (CID) and contains the public key material for `assertionMethod`s by default.

## Issuing and Verifying Capabilities

Capabilities are authorizations issued from someone and which authorize the issued holder to perform certain actions.
In this context, capabilities are based on Verifiable Credentials. Each capability is a signed VC (created with `crypto.vc.issuer.createVC`). You invoke (use) a capability with a Verifiable Presentation (VP).

See an [example below](#example-issuing-and-verifying-a-capability-chain).

### Creating a Capability and Chains

To create a capability (delegate a right to someone else), the VC issuer sets the `credentialSubject.id` to the ID of the actor being authorized.
For chains where the authorization is passed further on, the `credentialSubject.id` of the previous capability VC must match the `issuer` of the next VC in the chain. All information stored in the `credentialSubject`, except for the `id`, is dependent on the application of the capability.

### Creating a Capability Presentation

For invoking (using) a capability, you need to create a capability presentation with `crypto.vc.holder.createPresentation`. In the presentation's `verifiableCredential` property, set all verifiable credentials of the capability chain, if more than one is used.

To use the capability representation in a request, you need to serialize it as an unsigned JWT token (`"alg": "none"`). Use the token in the `Authorization` header: `Authorization: Bearer <signed VP serialized as JWT>`.
For ActivityPub activities, you don't need Authorization headers. Instead, add a `sec:capability` property to the activity that contains the VP.

### Capability Verification with `crypto.vc.verifier.verifyCapabilityPresentation`

#### Verification Steps and What is Not Checked

The verification of capabilities is performed using proof purpose classes, as implemented in [jsonld-signatures](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld-signatures) and the [vc package](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/vc). These classes ensure that the cryptographic proofs and delegation chains are valid.

**What is Checked:**

- **Challenge Validation**: Ensures that the challenge in the presentation matches the expected value.
- **Verification Method**: Confirms that the verification method used to sign the presentation is correct.
- **Controller Validation**: Verifies that the key of the controller (signer) is present in the controller document (e.g., WebID).
- **Capability Chain Validation**:
  - Ensures that the `credentialSubject.id` of each VC matches the `issuer` of the next VC in the chain.
  - Validates that the subject of the last VC in the chain matches the invoker (signer) of the presentation.
  - Allows for open capabilities (i.e., VCs without a `credentialSubject.id`) if there is only one VC in the chain.
- **Issuance and Proof Dates**: Ensures that all credentials have either an `issuanceDate` or `proof.created` property.
- **Holder Validation**: Confirms that the `holder` in the presentation matches the controller, if specified.
- **Chain Length**: Ensures that the number of VCs in the chain does not exceed the maximum allowed (`maxChainLength`).

**What is Not Checked:**

- **Business Logic**: The verification process does not validate the correctness of the `credentialSubject` content. For example, it does not ensure that a statement like "A is allowed to read B" is actually made by "B" and not by "C".
  Any additional rules or logic specific to the application must be implemented by the service that accepts capability-authorized API requests.

##### Return

`object` - The verification result. If verification succeeds, it will return `{ verified: true }`. If it fails, it will return `{ verified: false, error: <error> }`.

### Example: Issuing and Verifying a Capability Chain

_Some properties are omitted._

1. **Issuing the First Capability**:
   This capability will allow holders to see the issuer's profile (`apods:hasAuthorization`, which is checked in the [WebACL middleware](../webacl/index.md)) and send `Note` activities (assuming the user puts restrictions on that for strangers and the [activity handler](../activitypub/activities-handler.md) supports it. Disclaimer: For `Create > Note` activities, there is no handler capable as of now. The example is for illustrative purposes).

   ```json
   {
     "@context": [
       "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
       {
         "as": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#",
         "apods": "http://activitypods.org/ns/core#",
         "acl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#"
       }
     ],
     "id": "https://example.com/actor/issuer/credentials/111",
     "type": ["VerifiableCredential"],
     "issuer": "https://example.com/actor/issuer",
     "credentialSubject": {
       "id": "https://example.com/actor/holder",
       "apods:hasAuthorization": {
         "type": "acl:Authorization",
         "acl:mode": "acl:Read",
         "acl:accessTo": [
           "https://example.com/actor/issuer/profile-resource",
           "https://example.com/actor/issuer/profile-picture"
         ]
       },
       "apods:hasActivityGrant": {
         "type": "Create",
         "as:object": { "type": "Note" },
         "as:to": "https://example.com/actor/issuer"
       }
     },
     "issuanceDate": "2023-10-01T00:00:00Z"
   }
   ```

2. **Delegating the Capability**:
   The holder of the first VC creates a second VC and passes the second VC on.

   ```json
   {
     "id": "https://example.com/actor/holder/credentials/222",
     "type": ["VerifiableCredential"],
     "issuer": "https://example.com/actor/holder",
     "credentialSubject": {
       "id": "https://example.com/actor/delegate",
       "apods:hasAuthorization": {...},
       "apods:hasActivityGrant": {...}
     },
     "issuanceDate": "2023-10-02T00:00:00Z"
   }
   ```

3. **Creating a Capability Presentation**:
   The holder of the second VC creates a Verifiable Presentation containing both VCs. Before that, it needs to have obtained a challenge from the challenge endpoint of the original issuer (see below).

   ```json
   {
     "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],
     "verifiableCredential": [
       firstCapabilityVC ,
       secondCapabilityVC,
     ],
     "proof": {
       "type": "DataIntegrityProof",
       "cryptosuite": "eddsa-rdfc-2022",
       "created": "2023-10-03T00:00:00Z",
       "verificationMethod": "https://example.com/actor/delegate#key-1",
       "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
       "challenge": "random-challenge-string",
       "proofValue": "...",
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Verifying the Capability Presentation**:
   Use the `crypto.vc.verifier.verifyCapabilityPresentation` action to verify the presentation:

   ```javascript
   const result = await ctx.call('crypto.vc.verifier.verifyCapabilityPresentation', {
     verifiablePresentation: presentation,
     options: {
       maxChainLength: 2,
       challenge: 'random-challenge-string'
     }
   });

   if (result.verified) {
     console.log('Capability presentation is valid.');
   } else {
     console.error('Verification failed:', result.error);
   }
   ```

This process ensures that the delegation chain is valid and that the actor presenting the capability is authorized to perform the specified action.

### Capabilities without subject id / specified holder.

It is possible to create capabilities which are not issued to a specific holder. They do not have a `credentialSubject.id` property.
This is useful with invite links, for example, where you don't know the recipient's webId in advance.

Capabilities that do not have holders specified in their `credentialSubject.id` property, cannot be chained.

### Setting up Capability-Enabled Routes

To enable capability-based authorization for a route, set the `opts.authorizeWithCapability` option to `true` in the route configuration. This will ensure that the `authorize` action checks for valid capability presentations. You can specify the maximum allowed chain length with `opts.maxChainLength`. The default is `2`.

When a capability is successfully verified, as described above, the capability presentation is attached to `ctx.meta.authorization.capabilityPresentation` and can be used by the registered actions to check the validity of the business logic.

#### Example: `api.addRoute` configuration

```javascript
ctx.call('api.addRoute', {
  path: '/your/route',
  name: 'your-unique-route-name',
  aliases: {
    'GET /': 'your.action.here'
  },
  authorization: true,
  authentication: false,
  opts: {
    authorizeWithCapability: true,
    maxChainLength: 2
  }
});
```

## Challenge Service

##### Return

`string` - The created challenge.

### `crypto.vc.presentation.challenge.validate`

Validate a challenge.

##### Parameters

| Property    | Type     | Default      | Description                |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
