## Install

```

## Usage

```js
const { ActivityPubService } = require('@semapps/activitypub');

module.exports = {
  mixins: [ActivityPubService],
  settings: {
    baseUri: 'http://localhost:3000/',
    queueServiceUrl: null,
    activateTombestones: true
  }
};
```

### Configure the LDP containers

The containers for actors and objects are handled through the LDP service. You need to define containers with ActivityStreams's actors and objects in the `acceptedTypes`. Alternatively, you can load the default containers from the `@semapps/activitypub` package as below:

```js
const { LdpService } = require('@semapps/ldp');
const { containers: apContainers } = require('@semapps/activitypub');

module.exports = {
  mixins: [LdpService],
  settings: {
    baseUrl: process.env.SEMAPPS_HOME_URL,
    containers: ['/my-container', ...apContainers]
  }
};
```

### Queue federation POSTs

If you want to make sure no data is lost when trying to POST to remote ActivityPub servers, you can set the `dispatch.queueServiceUrl` settings.

The [Bull](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull) task manager will queue the task and you will be able to retry it if it fails.

### Create actors on account creations

An ActivityPub actor is automatically created when a `auth.registered` event is detected.

By default, it will:

- Append the `as:Person` type, unless another ActivityStreams [actor type](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#actor-types) is detected
- Use the slug of the actor as the `as:preferredUsername` property

You can adapt this behaviour to your needs with the `selectActorData` setting.
This function receives the data provided on signup (as JSON-LD), and must return the properties (with their full URI) to be appended.
For example:

```js
const selectActorData = userData => ({
  'http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type': 'https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Person',
  'https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#name': userData['foaf:name'],
  'https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#preferredUsername': userData['foaf:nick']
});
```

> Note: If no type or `as:preferredUsername` is returned by this function, it will behave as described above.

Additionally, the ActivityPub services will append all the ActivityPub-specific properties (`publicKey`, `followers`, `following`, `likes`...)
