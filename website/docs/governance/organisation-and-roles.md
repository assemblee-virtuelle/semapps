title: SemApps organisation and roles
---

Our team's organisation is inspired by sociocracy and shared governance.

The core team has described the first roles after a few iteration in May 2020 - you may refer to the original [pad](https://hackmd.io/SfSueIZlQmeD_ijfSyGtUw?both) (in french)
Those role have a purpose and accountability besides a referent which is [elected by consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy#Elections_by_consent_(principle_4)).

The objective of this organisation is to be very inclusive, evolutive and open to collective intelligence.

# Principles
- The mission described here are not supposed to be performed by the person who host it - People elected are referents who supervise the mission.
- A role can be very energized, or not very much. The important thing is that there is a person who remains vigilant, and who can be mobilized when necessary.
- It's OK to have more roles than contributors.
- A role can be energized by a circle or a single person, but there is always a single person identified as a referent.
- Roles are allocated by election by consent (no candidate)
- A role is autonomous to act and take decision within its own perimeter.

## Onboarding
